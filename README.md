# bms
A battery monitoring system.

It has no name.

You don't have the hardware to run it on.

It will compile under the Arduino IDE 1.5.x or newer

Pretend you're compiling for an Arduino DUE.

It uses a bunch of libraries that you can probably find
if you look hard enough...

There's nothing to see here. Shoo!
